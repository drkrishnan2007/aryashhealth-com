            <h1>About This Project</h1>
        </header>

        <p><span class="highlight">AI for Clinicians</span> is a free educational resource for doctors who want to understand, use, and build with artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p>This isn't a course created by AI researchers or tech companies. It's a practising GP's journey — learning alongside you, sharing what works, what doesn't, and what's actually useful in clinical practice.</p>

        <h2>Why I'm Making This</h2>
        <p>AI is changing medicine. Most clinicians know they should understand it, but:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expensive courses and fellowships aren't accessible to everyone</li>
            <li>Academic content often misses practical application</li>
            <li>Tech-focused resources assume knowledge we don't have</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wanted something different: <strong>free, practical, and made by a doctor who actually uses these tools</strong>.</p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <p>Bite-sized video episodes (5-10 minutes) covering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI fundamentals — what it actually is, no jargon</li>
            <li>Daily clinical use — documentation, communication, learning</li>
            <li>Getting better results — prompting techniques that work</li>
            <li>Beyond chat — automation, voice AI, custom tools</li>
            <li>Building things — from idea to working prototype</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The "Ask"</h2>
        <p>This content is free, always. If it helps you, I only ask one thing: <span class="highlight">pass it on</span>. Share with a colleague. Teach someone what you learned. That's how we all get better.</p>
